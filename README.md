# Linear-Regression
A linear regression model is trained using taxi data from Chicago to predict the expected fare.
This example was taken from Google ML Crash Course, which is also a source of the dataset  named chicago_taxi_train.csv
Things I have learned so far include:
Parameter, Hyperparameter, Hyperparameter tuning, dataset cleaning and exploration using pandas, plots using the Seaborn library, view data statistics to learn the importance of features, Model training (Plotting and ML functions), experimenting with features, plot reading, prediction making, and model evaluation.
